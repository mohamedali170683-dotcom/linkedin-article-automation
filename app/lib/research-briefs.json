    "brief": "Mental availability is defined by Romaniuk and Sharp as 'the probability that a buyer will notice, recognize and/or think of a brand in buying situations' dependent on 'the quality and quantity of memory structures related to the brand.' Mental availability ensures your brand is recalled in relevant buying moments, not just recognized. As the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute research shows, brands grow primarily by increasing their mental availability and physical availability. Brand growth comes from acquiring new and light buyers, and mental availability is the mechanism by which brands become easier to think of and therefore more likely to be chosen. The key is linking the brand to as many category entry points as possible. Our brain is a lazy organ that has evolved over millions of years to make good choices with as little energy consumption as possible. We operate automatically and use our attention sparingly. In purchasing environments, this leads to 99.99% of all stimuli being filtered out. This makes it difficult for brands to influence choice unless they have strong mental availability.",

System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.

As Kahneman notes, arbitrary rationing is an effective marketing ploy: supermarket shoppers in Sioux City, Iowa, bought significantly more Campbell's soup when presented with an anchor number. Dooley explains how Ariely discovered that MIT students bid 3x more when primed with a random higher number. If we decide to buy a big-screen television, we may spot one we like for $1,000.

The rate at which a brand grows or shrinks tends to be proportional to its extra share of voice (ESOV), defined as the difference between SOV and SOM. According to Nielsen research, every 10 points of excess SOV can drive approximately 0.5% of extra market share growth. The share of voice rule has been known for 50 years and holds true today, despite all the enormous changes in the media landscape. From Effectiveness in Context, the bigger the brand, the higher the base rate, meaning big brands can get away with setting share of voice slightly below market share and still maintain equilibrium. But small brands are more dependent on advertising to maintain market share. They need to keep SOV much more in line with SOM if they are to survive.

So typical is it for indebtedness to accompany the receipt of such things that a term like 'much obliged' has become a synonym for 'thank you.' The rule was established to promote the development of reciprocal relationships between individuals so that one person could initiate such a relationship without the fear of loss. An uninvited first favor must have the ability to create an obligation. The American Disabled Veterans organization found that its simple mail appeal for donations produces a response rate of about 18 percent. But when the mailing also includes an unsolicited gift (gummed, individualized address labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent.

Customers should always be able to make a different choice than the one you want them to. Research has shown that people's decisions are impacted by the way their options are presented. Removing friction and simplifying options can help people make the choice you hope they do. Your customers will have a strong preference for the status quo, for the way things are.

The scarcity principle trades on our weakness for shortcuts: because we know that things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to get, we can often use availability as a shortcut for quality. Harhut breaks scarcity into two sides: urgency and exclusivity. Urgency, expressed through limited quantities and limited times, motivates people to take action. Marketers can employ urgency using deadlines, countdown clocks, and restricted quantities. In a dramatic example, Cialdini describes a study where beef buyers who were told about future scarcity bought significantly more. Those who also learned the scarcity information was exclusive (the scarcity double whammy) purchased even more. The restriction of information made it both more desirable and more persuasive. As Cialdini notes, the finding was quite straightforward: the value of information was seen to grow if it was scarce. Not only was the commodity itself seen as more valuable, but the exclusive information about it was valued even more.",

Yet the symbols previously seen were consistently rated more positively. The familiarity had created a positive connotation. In a similar experiment, members of the group with repeated exposure reported being in better moods. Kahneman connects this to cognitive ease: repetition induces cognitive ease, and things that are cognitively easy feel more familiar and more likable. Stocks with pronounceable trading symbols (like KAR or LUNMOO) outperform those with tongue-twisting tickers like PXG or RDO.

Anchoring demonstrates that even arbitrary numbers influence purchasing decisions. The SOV/SOM relationship shows that share of voice drives market share growth. Reciprocity, choice architecture, distinctive brand assets, scarcity, and mere exposure all operate as System 1 shortcuts that shape brand selection.

Thaler and Sunstein provide a powerful example: telling homeowners they lose $350 per year from insufficient insulation (loss frame) is more effective than telling them they could save $350 per year (gain frame). Framing effects are exacerbated by the human tendency to occasionally be mindless, passive decision makers. Few of us bother to check whether reframing the decisions we face would produce a different answer. Shotton connects framing to Kahneman's WYSIATI concept: we make decisions based on the known knowns, considering only the information before us and ignoring potentially relevant factors we cannot perceive at that moment. As Kahneman writes, WYSIATI means that we use the information we have as if it is the only information. We do not consider what we might not know. This is why how you frame a choice matters enormously for marketing communications.",

Broad-reach advertising that elicits an emotional response and captures broad-beam attention is how you build and maintain strong brands.

The rise of the left-brained style of advertising has occurred in the last 10-15 years.

These memory-generated consideration sets are the foundation of Category Entry Points (CEPs). Professor Jenni Romaniuk introduces CEPs as the cues that buyers use when thinking about a category. The CEP roadmap involves four steps to building a winning marketing strategy. Brands need to build wider, fresher memory networks of CEPs linked to the brand. When building CEPs in marketing communications, there are three dimensions to consider: more decision makers, more CEPs per decision maker, and stronger links between CEPs and the brand. For B2B, the CEP framework extends to consider the professional as a person with their own desires and ambitions, such as making a splash to help get promoted. The long-term message strategy needs to build brand links to different CEPs rather than just continuously focusing on only one CEP.

Against a backdrop of exposure encompassing brands, products, and more, purchase triggers prompt consumers to enter a cycle of exploration and evaluation, gathering information and then narrowing it down. If the first cycle doesn't yield a definite choice, they loop back, repeating as many times as necessary. The exploration and evaluation loop is the defining characteristic of the messy middle, and the seemingly infinite construct is key. Consumers explore their options and expand their knowledge and consideration sets, then either sequentially or simultaneously evaluate the options and narrow down their choices. Behavioral science principles can be applied at several points within the messy middle. Brands should show up at key moments of exploration and evaluation to win or protect market share. Intelligent application of behavioral science can help create a compelling proposition that appeals to shoppers at an instinctive level. Pre-existing brand affinity and price are undoubted drivers, but purchase outcomes can also be strongly influenced by messages and tactics that competing brands bring into play.",

It does not make sense to evaluate an entire life by its last moments, or to give no weight to duration in deciding which life is more desirable, yet this is what our remembering self does.

Shotton draws on Milan Kundera's observation that 'memory does not make films, it makes photographs,' meaning we remember snapshots of events rather than their full duration.

Brand size and market share trajectory before stopping advertising affect the rate of market share loss. Such quantification facilitates financial forecasting and portfolio decision making concerning advertising cessations. Despite an appreciation of the risks, it is still common for brands to have extended periods when they do not advertise. Brands stop advertising for various reasons including pressure of inflating earnings to avoid buyouts, competition for budget across brand portfolios, or other business requirements.

Generative engines, in contrast to traditional search engines, remove the need to navigate to websites by directly providing a precise and comprehensive response, potentially reducing organic traffic to websites and impacting their visibility. GEO can improve the visibility of websites by up to 40% on a wide range of queries. The research proposes visibility metrics specifically designed for generative engines. Key optimization methods include Statistics Addition (adding relevant statistics), Quotation Addition (incorporating credible quotes), and Cite Sources (including citations from reliable sources). These methods achieved 30-40% relative improvement on Position-Adjusted Word Count metrics. SEO methods such as Keyword Stuffing perform poorly in generative engines. Lower-ranked websites benefit disproportionately from GEO optimization. The framework enables content creators to flexibly optimize their content for improved visibility in AI-generated search responses.",

Combining these measures, including the percentage of ads that could be seen, the percentage actually viewed, and the average eyes-on dwell time, allows estimation of attentive seconds per impression. This is critical because viewable does not mean it will be viewed. Dwell time dramatically affects recall: compared to the low dwell-time group, those who had longer exposure to ads were six times more likely to recall the ad, four times more likely to remember details, and fourteen times more likely to correctly remember the brand.

Rats will work to be exposed to a cue that signals that some kind of reward is likely, without knowing what or when. This is what fetishes are, in both the anthropological and sexual sense. The magnitude of an anticipatory dopamine rise reflects two variables: the size of the reward and the probability of receiving it. Adolescence is about risk taking and novelty seeking, driven by dopamine reward systems. We primates aren't driven out at adolescence. Instead we desperately crave novelty.

    "brief": "Cialdini introduces the Unity principle as the seventh principle of influence in Pre-Suasion. Unity is about shared identity, the sense that 'we' are part of the same group. This goes beyond mere similarity (covered by the Liking principle) to encompass genuine tribal bonds. When people perceive a shared identity with a communicator, they are more receptive to persuasion because the communicator is seen as 'one of us.' Pre-Suasion shows that even subtle environmental cues can trigger shared identity: women perform better on math, science, and leadership tasks if assigned to rooms with cues (photos, for example) of women known to have mastered the tasks. The recommendation that ethical reputation should be part of assessments and that ratings by employees of a firm's ethical orientation should be a component of senior management's compensation shows how unity operates within organizations. True unity comes from shared experiences, shared values, and co-creation, not just demographic similarity.",

    "brief": "Pricing psychology reveals that consumers don't evaluate prices rationally. Dooley explains that precise pricing actually works: people are fooled by prices that are a penny cheaper despite conventional wisdom suggesting nobody is fooled. Removing dollar signs from prices dramatically improved willingness to purchase, with spending six percent more on average when the dollar sign was removed. How the price is graphically presented also matters. Sutherland notes that a £200 dress reduced to £75 is fine, but women may not feel happy wearing a £75 dress to a wedding. Economic logic as a psychology-free model based on presumptions of rationality can be a very costly mistake. Barden's Decoded approach suggests starting with the best option and getting customers to subtract down, rather than building from a base. In a 2022 study of 404 shoppers, Haagen-Dazs looked 52% better value when compared to a costlier Halo Top ($4.99) versus a cheaper Walmart tub ($1.99). The value judgment didn't change due to the product itself, but the comparison context.",

    "brief": "Cialdini identifies liking as a powerful principle of influence. Joe Girard, the world's greatest car salesman, attributed his success to just two things: a fair price and someone the customer liked to buy from. Physical attractiveness is one factor: studies show that attractive people are more likely to receive favorable treatment. But similarity is perhaps more powerful: we like people who are like us. It's a fact that applies to human infants as well as adults. Compliance practitioners leverage similarity by mirroring the target's opinions, traits, and behaviors. Compliments also generate liking, even when the recipient suspects ulterior motives. As Mae West observed, 'Flattery will get you everywhere.' Waitresses who compliment diners' choices get larger tips. The key defense against the liking principle is to be alert to a sense of undue liking for a compliance practitioner and to separate the requester from the request. Once immersed in even brief personal contact with a requester, we may easily forget that distinction.",

    "brief": "Cognitive load theory explains how mental effort constraints affect decision-making. Kahneman describes how when a critical stimulus was presented at a time of high demand, subjects simply did not see it. When the task was less demanding, detection performance was better. This demonstrates the sophisticated allocation of attention: the brain cannot process everything simultaneously. Cialdini connects this to persuasion: in addition to its time-challenged character, modern life undermines our ability and motivation to think thoroughly. We're not able to focus on the real quality of an advertiser's case in a radio or television spot. Nor are we able to respond mindfully to a news clip. Instead, we're left to focus on secondary features of the presentations, such as the attractiveness of the spokesperson or the politician's charisma. Mental multiplication of two-digit numbers and similar tasks are near the limit of what most people can do, and the request to retrieve information while organizing a response requires significant effort. Understanding cognitive load helps marketers design communications that work within cognitive constraints rather than fighting against them.",

    "brief": "The availability heuristic is employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the likelihood of an event. A person is said to employ the availability heuristic when they assess frequency by the ease with which instances come to mind. Kahneman and Tversky established three key heuristics for judgment under uncertainty: representativeness, availability of instances or scenarios, and anchoring. The availability heuristic means that events that are more memorable or vivid are judged as more frequent, regardless of actual statistical frequency. This creates systematic biases: dramatic events (plane crashes) are judged as more common than mundane ones (car accidents) because they are more memorable. The heuristic extends to social perception: erroneous perceptions with severe consequences may persist because there is a bias in the formation of a judgment that leads to a bias in maintaining that judgment via the cognitive structure formed. These complementary biases can be highly resistant to correction.",

Unless action is taken to cancel, the subscription continues indefinitely. In Harhut's research, subjects told to imagine they had inherited money and given four investment portfolios to choose from showed strong status quo bias: when one portfolio was described as the one currently holding the money, it was disproportionately chosen. The endowment effect is related: in experiments, half the students received coffee mugs and half got chocolate bars. When offered the opportunity to switch, only one in ten did. Your customers will have a strong preference for the status quo, for the way things are. It might be due to familiarity, loss aversion, time and effort already invested, or habit. Marketers should have inertia work in their favor by making 'doing nothing' actually result in the behavior they seek.",

    "brief": "The IKEA effect, identified by researchers Michael Norton and Dan Ariely, demonstrates that when you build IKEA furniture yourself you prefer it to pre-built furniture. If you see the labor that's gone into a task, you'll value it more. Sutherland traces this to Betty Crocker: when instant cake mixes required only adding water, sales were poor. When the recipe was changed to require adding an egg, sales increased. The psychologists believed that doing a little more work made consumers feel less guilty while still saving time, but making just enough effort to give the sense of having contributed. The IKEA effect requires task completion: participants who fully built a box valued it more, but the effect disappears if the task is not completed. Shotton describes the related labour illusion: when participants were shown a suitable date, being transparent about the effort made users even happier. But when shown an unsuitable date, transparency about effort made them even unhappier. It seems this effect exaggerates people's opinions of brands rather than overturns them. In a study of children ages 3-6, five and six year olds rated toy monsters they helped build more highly, suggesting the effect emerges with identity development.",

At the influence level, Cialdini's seven principles (reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity, unity) provide systematic levers for persuasion. At the market level, the 60:40 rule (Binet & Field), SOV/SOM relationship, double jeopardy law, and 95-5 rule establish the evidence base for marketing investment. At the measurement level, the effectiveness crisis demands new metrics including Share of Search, attention seconds, and mental availability tracking. At the creative level, emotional right-brain advertising (Wood) outperforms rational left-brain approaches, while psycho-logic (Sutherland) shows that the opposite of a good idea can be a good idea. Together, this framework provides a complete evidence-based system for marketing that challenges conventional wisdom at every turn.",
