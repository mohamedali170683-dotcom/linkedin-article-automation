    "brief": "Binet and Field's analysis of the IPA Databank demonstrates that brand building is the primary driver of long-term growth and profitability. Their meta-analysis covers 996 case studies, 700 brands, 83 categories over 30 years. Effectiveness is measured in terms of effects, not prizes. This distinction is critical because prize-winning creativity and business-building creativity are not always the same thing. The sheer scale of this dataset makes it one of the most robust bodies of evidence in marketing science, and the conclusions are consistent across geographies, categories, and time periods.\n\nAnnualised ESOV efficiency relates share growth per annum to ESOV as the primary measure of efficiency. The practical implication is that if sales success is measured over a period of less than 6 months, then the metric will favour short-term communications and marketing tactics; if over longer than 6 months, then the metric will favour long-term communications and marketing. This measurement window bias systematically distorts investment decisions, creating an illusion that activation spending is more efficient when in reality it is merely more immediately visible.\n\nThe Consumer Behaviour textbook provides the underlying theory for why brand building ROI follows a specific curve. The advertising response function is concave to the x-axis and is an example of diminishing marginal returns. When this occurs, the most cost-effective number of exposures is one per person. This means brand building is most efficient when it prioritizes broad reach over repeated frequency against narrow audiences. Each additional exposure to the same individual yields progressively less return, while each new individual reached represents the steepest point on the response curve.\n\nThe LinkedIn B2B Report adds critical evidence from the Bass Diffusion Model, demonstrating that ads accelerate early growth and ads maintain higher sales over time. The Bass model shows that advertising does not merely shift demand forward in time; it genuinely expands the total market by accelerating adoption among innovators and early majority buyers. Without advertising, diffusion still occurs through word-of-mouth, but the growth trajectory is slower and the ultimate market size may be smaller. This mathematically validates what Binet and Field observe empirically: brand building creates compound returns.\n\nThere is a growing tendency to use very short-term online metrics as primary performance measures. So the major threat in practice is that the use of short-term metrics will damage the long-term profitability of brands. This threat will increase with the movement towards real-time campaign management. Dashboard-driven marketing optimization, while appearing scientific, can actively destroy brand value by starving brand building of resources. The irony is that the most sophisticated-looking measurement approaches often produce the most damaging investment decisions.\n\nBrand price elasticity should be tracked: the lower the better. And strength of promotional response should be monitored: big responses are a sign of a weak brand. A brand that requires deep discounts to drive volume has weak equity. Conversely, a brand that maintains sales at full price demonstrates strong brand building ROI. These metrics provide the long-term health indicators that short-term dashboards miss entirely. The Bass Diffusion Model confirms that sustained advertising investment not only accelerates initial adoption but maintains a permanently higher sales baseline, making the ROI of brand building cumulative rather than transient.",

    "brief": "Measuring mental availability requires tracking brand links to category entry points. Romaniuk and Sharp define mental availability metrics based on the quality and quantity of memory structures related to the brand. The key is measuring how many CEPs a brand is linked to, and how strong those links are. This requires tracking the brand's presence in consumers' memories across different buying situations. Brand Salience research formalizes this: salience is conceptualised as the probability that a customer will think of the brand at some point in time. This probabilistic framing moves measurement from binary awareness to a continuous scale of likelihood.\n\nUnlike traditional brand tracking which focuses on unaided and aided awareness, mental availability measurement captures whether a brand comes to mind in specific purchase contexts. This is a fundamentally different question: not 'do you know this brand?' but 'would you think of this brand when you need X?' The distinction between awareness and mental availability explains why some well-known brands still lose market share. A brand can score highly on awareness while being linked to very few category entry points, leaving it mentally unavailable in most actual buying situations.\n\nMeasuring advertising's effect on mental availability will begin to provide expected benchmarks for marketers and aid development of strategies to build a brand's mental availability under conditions specific to the category. As mental availability is a competitive process, the advertising activity of competitors will also have an impact on memory, so comparing brands in the same category provides important extension. This competitive dimension means that maintaining mental availability requires ongoing investment; standing still while competitors advertise is effectively moving backward.\n\nThe Distinctive Asset Grid, developed by Romaniuk, provides the systematic measurement framework for tracking brand asset performance across two critical dimensions: fame (how widely known the asset is among category buyers) and uniqueness (how exclusively the asset is associated with one brand rather than competitors). Assets are plotted on the grid and classified into categories ranging from 'Avoid Alone' to 'Use or Lose,' giving brand managers clear, actionable guidance on which assets to invest in, which to protect, and which to retire.\n\nTogether with CEP measurement, the Distinctive Asset Grid creates a comprehensive toolkit for monitoring both dimensions of mental availability: being thought of in buying situations (CEPs) and being correctly identified when encountered (distinctive assets). Both dimensions must be tracked and managed simultaneously to maintain and grow mental availability. A brand that is thought of frequently but not correctly identified wastes its mental availability advantage, while a brand that is easily identified but rarely thought of in buying situations has distinctiveness without salience.\n\nThe practical measurement protocol involves surveying category buyers on which brands come to mind for each CEP, then tracking these metrics over time and against competitors. This longitudinal competitive tracking is more informative than snapshot brand health studies because it reveals trends in relative mental availability. Combined with the Distinctive Asset Grid audit, marketers gain a complete picture of their brand's position in consumer memory and can make evidence-based decisions about where to invest in building or strengthening memory structures.",

    "sources": "Phua, Hartnett, Beal, Trinh & Kennedy (Journal of Advertising Research, 2023), Ephron, Consumer Behaviour Applications in Marketing (advertising continuity), Binet & Field",
    "brief": "Research published in the Journal of Advertising Research examines what happens when brands stop advertising for a year or longer. Using market share as the measure (where prior research used sales), losses were quantified as declining by 10 percent after one year, 20 percent after two years, and 28 percent after three years relative to the last advertised year, on average. These are not small numbers; they represent existential threats to brand viability. The compounding nature of these losses means that the cost of going dark accelerates over time, making recovery progressively more expensive.\n\nBrand size and market share trajectory before stopping advertising affect the rate of market share loss. Larger brands with strong momentum decay more slowly, but even they are not immune to the corrosive effects of advertising cessation. Such quantification facilitates financial forecasting and portfolio decision making concerning advertising cessations. For the first time, marketers can model the cost of going dark against the cost of continued investment, transforming what was previously a qualitative argument into a quantitative one with clear financial implications.\n\nThe Consumer Behaviour textbook provides the theoretical foundation for why continuity matters through the lens of diminishing marginal returns and advertising response curves. Because advertising response is concave and the most cost-effective exposure is the first one, continuous advertising that reaches people once is more valuable than sporadic bursts that reach fewer people multiple times. Going dark eliminates even that crucial first exposure for new potential buyers entering the category, severing the brand from the flow of future demand entirely.\n\nDespite an appreciation of the risks, it is still common for brands to have extended periods when they do not advertise. Brands stop advertising for various reasons including pressure of inflating earnings to avoid buyouts, competition for budget across brand portfolios, or other business requirements. The short-term financial gains from cutting advertising budgets are real but temporary, while the market share losses compound over time. CFOs who cut advertising to meet quarterly targets are borrowing from the brand's future at punitive interest rates.\n\nEphron advocated that advertising needs continuity, because not being there with a message is like being out-of-stock. The shelf-space metaphor is powerful because it reframes advertising from a discretionary expense to an operational necessity. Just as a retailer would never voluntarily take products off shelves, brands should never voluntarily remove themselves from the advertising landscape. The research adds to the evidence that continuity over the long-term benefits brand performance.\n\nThe practical implications extend beyond simply maintaining advertising budgets. Even reduced-weight continuous campaigns protect brand health more effectively than on-off flighting patterns with the same total spend. The key insight is that regularity of presence matters more than intensity of presence. Binet and Field's observation that marketing appears to be sleepwalking towards a precipice takes on additional urgency when combined with the Phua et al. data: the industry is not just at risk of suboptimal spending but of systematic brand destruction through advertising cessation.",

    "brief": "Generative Engine Optimization is the first general optimization framework for website owners to optimize their websites for generative engines. Generative engines, in contrast to traditional search engines, remove the need to navigate to websites by directly providing a precise and comprehensive response, potentially reducing organic traffic to websites and impacting their visibility. GEO can improve the visibility of websites by up to 40% on a wide range of queries. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how brands maintain findability in a world where search engines increasingly provide answers rather than links.\n\nThe research proposes visibility metrics specifically designed for generative engines. Key optimization methods include Statistics Addition (adding relevant statistics), Quotation Addition (incorporating credible quotes), and Cite Sources (including citations from reliable sources). These methods achieved 30-40% relative improvement on Position-Adjusted Word Count metrics. SEO methods such as Keyword Stuffing perform poorly in generative engines. Lower-ranked websites benefit disproportionately from GEO optimization, suggesting that GEO could democratize visibility in ways that traditional SEO has not.\n\nHarvard research on Manipulating LLMs reveals a framework to game an LLM's recommendations in favor of a target product by inserting a strategic text sequence (STS). The research demonstrates that a product can go from not being recommended to the top recommendation in 100 iterations. This shows both the opportunity and the vulnerability in AI-driven search: brands that understand how LLMs process and recommend content can gain significant competitive advantage, while the potential for manipulation raises serious questions about the integrity of AI-generated recommendations.\n\nData from How to Rank in ChatGPT provides compelling evidence: AI search visitors convert at 4.4x higher rates than traditional search visitors. ChatGPT mentions brands 3.2x more often than it provides clickable citations, suggesting that brand mentions in AI outputs may be more important than link-based SEO. This fundamentally changes the calculus of search optimization, shifting focus from ranking on a results page to being mentioned in a generated response. The implication is that brand building and content authority matter more in the GEO era than technical SEO manipulation.\n\nThe convergence of these findings points to a future where brand visibility depends on authoritative, well-cited content that LLMs can reference with confidence. Brands that invest in producing original research, publishing credible statistics, and building genuine expertise will be preferentially surfaced by generative engines. This aligns remarkably well with the evidence-based marketing principles established throughout Q3: broad brand building, mental availability, and authentic authority all contribute to GEO performance.\n\nFor marketers, GEO represents both a threat and an opportunity. The threat is that traditional search traffic will decline as generative engines provide direct answers, reducing the value of conventional SEO investments. The opportunity is that brands with strong mental availability, distinctive positioning, and authoritative content will be disproportionately recommended by AI systems. The brands that win in GEO are those that have already won in the minds of the humans who created the training data and the content that LLMs reference.",

    "brief": "Les Binet introduces Share of Search as a new metric: the ratio of searches for a brand to searches for all brands in the category. Share of searches correlates with market share across multiple categories tested. This metric leverages the world's biggest database of human intentions (search data). The elegance of Share of Search lies in its simplicity and accessibility: unlike SOV data, which requires expensive media spend tracking, search data is freely available through search engine tools, democratizing competitive intelligence.\n\nJames Hankins, writing in WARC, introduces Share of Search and presents several useful and applicable techniques for practitioners. His paper provides the methodological rigor needed to move Share of Search from an interesting observation to a practical planning tool. The techniques cover how to clean search data, account for seasonality, handle brand name ambiguity, and interpret trends in the context of competitive dynamics. This practical guidance transforms an academic finding into an actionable marketing metric.\n\nThe IPA group's validation research, led by Binet and joined by Google, LinkedIn, Unilever, Kantar, Mediacom, and Zenith, confirms that media investment effects can be tracked through Share of Search. This coalition of major industry players lending their data and analytical resources provides extraordinary credibility to the metric. MyTelescope was invited to join the IPA group, contributing both data and advanced analytics. The breadth of this validation effort across categories, geographies, and methodologies makes Share of Search one of the most thoroughly validated new metrics in marketing.\n\nEDO research adds a crucial performance dimension: SoM Growers have Search Engagement Rates that correlate with growth. This finding connects Share of Search to actual business outcomes rather than merely establishing a statistical correlation with market share. Brands that are growing their market share show corresponding patterns in search engagement, creating a feedback loop between mental availability, search behavior, and commercial performance.\n\nHowever, the approach has methodological limitations: you need to be careful about brands with common words in their names (like Nutmeg, which could pick up people looking for the spice). Similarly, if a major brand has multiple offerings or too large a footprint, it could confuse the analysis. These challenges require careful handling through data cleaning techniques and category-specific adjustments, but they do not invalidate the core finding.\n\nShare of Search is particularly powerful as a leading indicator of market share changes, giving marketers early warning signals about competitive dynamics. When share of search rises, market share tends to follow. When it falls, market share typically declines. This leading indicator quality makes it invaluable for strategic planning, competitive monitoring, and early detection of threats, especially in categories where market share data is expensive, delayed, or unavailable.",

    "sources": "Lumen Research, WARC (The True Cost of Advertising Attention), Follett, Shotton (The Choice Factory), TVision, Attention Measurement Research",
    "brief": "Mike Follett's cross-media attention research combines attention data from TVision and Lumen to show how much visual engagement ads in different media generate and whether this extra attention is reflected in the price advertisers pay. The research reveals not only what consumers could see (what was viewable), but also what they did in fact look at (what they viewed) and, crucially, how long they looked at the ad for. This three-layered distinction between opportunity to see, actual viewing, and dwell time is fundamental to understanding true advertising impact.\n\nThe WARC paper provides a precise methodology for quantifying attention. Combining these measures, the percentage of ads that could be seen, the percentage actually viewed, and the average eyes-on dwell time, allows us to estimate attentive seconds per thousand impressions. This composite metric reveals dramatic differences across media channels that raw impression counts completely obscure. A thousand impressions in one medium may deliver ten times the attentive seconds of a thousand impressions in another, yet both are priced similarly.\n\nA striking finding from the research is that only 74% of 30-second TV ads achieve viewability standards, suggesting around 25% of TV ads play out to empty rooms. This challenges the assumption that TV delivers guaranteed eyeballs and reveals that even the most established medium suffers from significant attention leakage. When combined with the fact that viewable does not mean viewed, the actual attention delivered by TV is substantially lower than media buyers traditionally assume.\n\nDwell time dramatically affects recall: compared to the low dwell-time group, those who had longer exposure to ads were six times more likely to recall the ad, four times more likely to remember details, and fourteen times more likely to correctly remember the brand. These multipliers demonstrate that attention quality, not just attention quantity, drives advertising effectiveness. The relationship between dwell time and brand recall is not linear but exponential, meaning small increases in attention produce outsized gains in memory formation.\n\nThe distinction between viewability and actual attention is fundamental for media planning. Media that delivers high viewability but low actual attention may be overpriced relative to its true impact. Conversely, media with lower viewability metrics but higher actual attention (longer dwell times when viewed) may deliver superior value. This reframes media evaluation from crude impression counting to attention-quality assessment, potentially reshaping media budgets significantly.\n\nFor practitioners, the attentive seconds per thousand metric provides a common currency for comparing media channels on a like-for-like basis. When combined with cost data, it enables calculation of cost per attentive second, a metric that reveals which media deliver genuine attention efficiently versus which sell expensive viewability that translates into minimal actual engagement. This approach gives planners the tools to make evidence-based media allocation decisions that optimize for the outcome that matters: attention that creates memory.",

    "topic": "Double Jeopardy Law",
    "sources": "Sharp (How Brands Grow), Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, DJ 50 Years On, Double Jeopardy Mathematical Foundations",
    "brief": "The Law of Double Jeopardy, tested extensively over fifty years, shows that smaller brands suffer twice: they have fewer buyers AND those buyers are slightly less loyal. As Sharp demonstrates with shampoo data, smaller brands suffer from only slightly lower loyalty. The primary difference between big and small brands is penetration (number of buyers), not loyalty (purchase frequency per buyer). This is one of the most replicated findings in all of marketing science.\n\nBrands grow primarily by increasing their market penetration. The law has been extensively tested over thirty-five years or more and provides a key to how brands grow. The DJ 50 Years On paper adds crucial precision to the measurement: penetration measures rise dramatically (often doubling between a quarter and a year). This temporal dimension means that the timeframe over which penetration is measured significantly affects the observed double jeopardy pattern. Short measurement windows understate a brand's true penetration and overstate loyalty differences between brands.\n\nThe mathematical underpinning is described through the w(1-b) approximation, which provides a precise model for the double jeopardy relationship between penetration and purchase frequency. This approximation shows that average purchase frequency is a mathematical function of penetration in a predictable way. The elegance of this model lies in its parsimony: a simple equation explains the relationship between brand size, penetration, and loyalty across dozens of product categories without requiring category-specific parameters.\n\nWhen Double Jeopardy constrains choice behaviour, brand share growth depends on substantially increasing the size of the customer base rather than managing customer loyalty. Jim Nyce, previously Insights Director at Kraft, describes this as 'swimming downstream.' Try as one might, if you are successful in gaining sales it's unlikely you'll break the double jeopardy law. And the IPA Effectiveness Awards results remind us that it is a much better strategy to go with the law than against it. Working with the double jeopardy law means prioritizing penetration growth through broad reach marketing.\n\nDouble jeopardy applies across categories from shampoo to ready-mix concrete, from radio stations to political parties. This universality is what makes it a law rather than a tendency. The practical implication is revolutionary: marketers should focus on customer acquisition through broad reach rather than customer retention through loyalty programs. The evidence consistently shows that growth comes from getting more buyers, not from getting existing buyers to buy more.\n\nThe implications for loyalty programs and CRM strategies are profound. If the double jeopardy law holds, then loyalty differences between brands are largely a mathematical artifact of penetration differences rather than the result of superior customer experience or relationship management. This does not mean customer experience is unimportant; it means that loyalty is an outcome of brand size rather than a driver of it. Resources invested in loyalty programs may be more productively redirected toward acquisition-focused, broad-reach brand building.",

Understanding this curve is essential for efficient budget allocation and represents one of the most important findings in media planning science.\n\nThe Consumer Behaviour textbook provides detailed analysis of the diminishing marginal returns curve at page 574. The advertising response function is concave to the x-axis, meaning initial exposures generate the greatest returns while subsequent exposures yield progressively less. When this occurs, the most cost-effective number of exposures (effective frequency) is one per person and it is best to use a continuous schedule that spreads advertising across the target population as widely as possible. This finding directly contradicts the traditional media planning approach of building frequency against a narrow target.\n\nThe textbook's media planning section at page 561 extends this analysis to audience reach, demonstrating that the principles of diminishing returns apply not only to individual exposure frequency but to overall media schedule efficiency. As a media plan reaches higher proportions of the target audience, the cost of reaching each additional person increases, creating diminishing returns at the reach level as well. The optimal strategy therefore balances broad reach with cost efficiency, seeking to reach as many category buyers as possible at least once before investing in additional frequency.\n\nEat Your Greens at page 135 reinforces this through the lens of reach and penetration. The evidence on advertising elasticity aligns with the double jeopardy law and penetration-focused growth: because brands grow by getting more buyers rather than more purchases from existing buyers, advertising should prioritize reaching new potential buyers rather than repeatedly exposing current customers. Reach drives penetration, and penetration drives growth.\n\nAdvertising elasticity is high for new brands but lower for established ones. Many long-established brands have built a useful track record of experience with varying levels of advertising pressure, and in many cases, econometric studies have produced a specific advertising elasticity. This body of evidence enables precise calibration of advertising investment for established brands, allowing them to set budgets based on empirical response curves rather than rules of thumb.\n\nThe advertising elasticity of most brands is low, which means competitors need not fear an opportunistic advertising increase too much. Even if a brand goes it alone and reduces advertising, sales may not suffer markedly in the short term, though long-term effects will accumulate. This creates a dangerous temptation: cutting advertising budgets shows no immediate penalty but steadily erodes brand health. The asymmetry between short-term cost savings and long-term brand decay makes advertising cuts appear rational in the short term while being destructive in the long term. Understanding advertising elasticity curves should make marketers better stewards of brand investment by revealing the true shape of returns.",

    "sources": "LinkedIn B2B Institute (Five Principles of Growth), Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, LinkedIn B2B Report (Bass Diffusion Model, p.4, p.11, p.16, p.21)",
    "brief": "The LinkedIn B2B Institute, drawing on Ehrenberg-Bass research, highlights that at any given time approximately 95% of potential buyers are out-of-market, not actively looking to buy. Only about 5% are in-market at any moment. This has profound implications for both B2B and B2C marketing strategy, fundamentally challenging the performance marketing paradigm that targets only those showing immediate purchase intent.\n\nThe LinkedIn B2B Report articulates the Five Principles of Growth at page 4: invest in share of voice, balance brand and activation, maximize reach, maximize mental availability, and harness the power of emotion. These five principles, derived from decades of empirical evidence, provide a complete strategic framework for B2B marketers. Yet over 65% of B2B marketers believe that businesses grow by increasing loyalty, not customer acquisition. This discrepancy presents B2B marketers with a precious, career-making opportunity: to be both right and contrarian.\n\nThe Bass Diffusion Model evidence at page 11 provides mathematical validation for the 95-5 rule's implications. The model demonstrates that advertising can generate further growth beyond organic word-of-mouth diffusion. Ads accelerate early growth and maintain higher sales over time. Without advertising, a product's adoption curve relies solely on interpersonal influence, which is slower and reaches a lower ultimate penetration. With advertising, the curve is both steeper and higher, demonstrating that brand building among the 95% creates measurable compound returns.\n\nAt page 16, the report provides evidence that brand building reduces price sensitivity, a crucial finding for the 95-5 framework. When brands invest in building mental availability among future buyers, they create not only future demand but future demand at higher margins. The out-of-market 95% who have strong brand associations are less price-sensitive when they eventually enter the market, meaning brand building simultaneously grows volume and protects margins. This dual benefit makes brand building the most strategically valuable investment a marketer can make.\n\nPage 21 of the report makes the case for mass-market advertising in B2B, directly challenging the assumption that B2B audiences are too narrow for broad-reach media. The evidence shows that B2B buying committees are larger, more diverse, and more influenced by brand reputation than traditional B2B marketing assumes. Mass-market advertising reaches not only current decision-makers but future ones, as well as influencers, users, and gatekeepers within target organizations. Only 52% of B2B marketers believe reach is a strong predictor of advertising success. Those B2B marketers who are brave enough to reject consensus opinion and bet big on evidence-based principles will outperform their competition.\n\nThe 95-5 rule explains why brand building is essential: if you only target the 5% currently in-market, you miss the 95% who will enter the market in coming months and years. Brand building creates mental availability among future buyers so that when they do enter the market, your brand is already in their consideration set. Performance marketing captures demand that brand building creates. Without brand building, the pool of demand available for performance marketing steadily shrinks, creating a death spiral of declining returns from activation spending.",

    "brief": "The reach vs frequency debate centers on whether it's better to reach more people fewer times or fewer people more times. The evidence from Sharp, Ehrenberg-Bass, and multiple independent sources strongly favors maximizing reach. This conclusion follows directly from diminishing marginal returns, the double jeopardy law, and the 95-5 rule, creating a convergent body of evidence that is difficult to dispute.\n\nMedia in Focus provides one of the most striking quantifications: reach may account for around 83% of the variations in media effectiveness. This means that of all the media planning decisions a marketer can make, the decision about how many people to reach is by far the most consequential. Frequency, media mix, timing, and other planning variables together explain only about 17% of the variation. This finding alone should reshape media planning priorities.\n\nThe Consumer Behaviour textbook at page 574 provides the underlying theory: advertising response follows diminishing marginal returns, making the most cost-effective number of exposures one per person. It is best to use a continuous schedule that spreads the advertising across the target population as widely as possible. In this way, more people are reached, maximizing the return on advertising investment. The concave response curve means that every dollar spent on a second exposure to the same person would generate more return if redirected to a first exposure to a new person.\n\nSystem1's Long and Short research at page 34 adds a crucial strategic dimension: broad reach is superior to tight targeting for brand building. While tight targeting may appear more efficient on a cost-per-action basis, it systematically under-invests in the future buyer base. Broad reach ensures that brand-building messages reach light and non-buyers who represent the brand's growth potential, while tight targeting speaks only to those already predisposed to buy, reinforcing existing patterns rather than driving growth.\n\nEphron advocated for weekly reach planning, which would mean being on air for more weeks at a lower weight. This shelf-space advertising model argues that advertising needs continuity because not being there with a message is like being out-of-stock. The metaphor is powerful: just as empty shelf space represents lost sales opportunities, advertising gaps represent lost opportunities to influence the constant flow of potential buyers entering and exiting the market.\n\nThe implication is clear: broad reach with lower frequency is more efficient than narrow reach with high frequency, particularly for brand building. Combined with the 95-5 rule (95% of potential buyers are out-of-market at any time), maximizing reach ensures that the brand message reaches as many future buyers as possible. The traditional media planning obsession with building frequency against a narrow target actively works against the evidence on how brands grow. When 83% of media effectiveness variation comes from reach, the strategic priority is unmistakable.",

    "brief": "Binet and Field document a growing marketing effectiveness crisis driven by short-termism. There is a growing tendency to use very short-term online metrics as primary performance measures. The major threat is that the use of short-term metrics will damage the long-term profitability of brands. This threat will increase with the movement towards real-time campaign management and its inevitable focus on short-term results. The crisis is not theoretical; IPA Databank analysis shows declining effectiveness across the industry.\n\nTo an alarming degree, marketing appears to be sleepwalking towards a precipice, and there is an urgent need for long-term metrics to reassert their importance. The IPA Databank shows that if advertising effects decay in a non-exponential manner, it is almost impossible to predict the long-term sales effects of marketing activity from short-term responses. This raises serious questions about the reliability of short-term optimization and the attribution models that drive modern digital media buying.\n\nThe Consumer Behaviour textbook at page 601 provides essential scientific context for the crisis: marketing scientists applied relevant methods under controlled scientific conditions to establish the laws and principles that the industry is now systematically ignoring. The findings on diminishing marginal returns, the double jeopardy law, the importance of reach over frequency, and the primacy of penetration over loyalty were not discovered through casual observation but through rigorous scientific inquiry. The effectiveness crisis represents the gap between what marketing science has established and what marketing practice actually does.\n\nKahneman's Noise adds a critical dimension to the effectiveness crisis. Noise is variability in judgments that should be identical. If judgments vary for no good reason, then Noise is detrimental. Applied to marketing measurement, this means that inconsistency in how marketing effectiveness is evaluated, across teams, time periods, and methodologies, introduces systematic error that compounds the short-termism problem. When measurement itself is noisy, optimizing against that measurement creates the illusion of improvement while potentially destroying value.\n\nMedia in Focus confirms that mass marketing still works, tight targeting has limitations, and the digital era requires new approaches to measuring effectiveness. The data shows that reach accounts for approximately 83% of the variation in media effectiveness, yet the industry continues to invest heavily in precision targeting that limits reach. The crisis is not that marketing doesn't work; it's that the industry has adopted measurement systems that systematically undervalue what works (brand building, broad reach) while overvaluing what is easily measured (short-term activation, click-through rates).\n\nThe path out of the crisis requires a return to the scientific foundations of marketing effectiveness. This means measuring over longer timeframes, prioritizing reach and mental availability metrics, acknowledging the limitations of attribution modeling, and having the courage to invest in activities whose returns are real but not immediately measurable. The effectiveness crisis is fundamentally a crisis of measurement and incentives, not a crisis of marketing's ability to drive business outcomes.",

    "brief": "Attribution modeling faces fundamental challenges in accurately measuring marketing's contribution to business results. Binet and Field's work in Effectiveness in Context reveals that the migration from premium to value pricing is partly driven by brands focusing more on volume than pricing, a consequence of attribution models that favor measurable short-term activation over harder-to-measure brand building. The evidence shows that attribution-driven budget allocation has systematically weakened brand equity across the industry.\n\nIf sales success is measured over a period of less than 6 months, the metric will favour short-term communications; if over longer than 6 months, it will favour long-term brand building. The implication is that most attribution models, which operate on short timeframes of days or weeks, systematically undervalue brand building by a factor that compounds over time. This creates a vicious cycle where budgets shift toward easily measurable activation, weakening brands, which then require more activation to maintain sales, further justifying the shift away from brand building.\n\nAnnie Duke's Thinking in Bets provides a crucial insight into the cognitive bias that corrupts attribution. At page 134, she establishes that if the outcome is known, it will bias the assessment of decision quality to align with the outcome quality. This resulting (judging decisions by their outcomes rather than their process) plagues marketing attribution profoundly. A brand-building campaign that coincides with a market downturn is judged as ineffective, while an activation campaign that coincides with seasonal demand is celebrated as a success. The outcome contaminates the evaluation of the decision, making it impossible to learn from experience.\n\nKay and King's Radical Uncertainty deepens the challenge from a philosophical level: probabilistic estimates were unhelpful for understanding unique, complex situations. Marketing campaigns exist in unrepeatable contexts with countless confounding variables. Attribution attempts to apply probabilistic thinking to situations that are fundamentally uncertain, not merely risky. The difference matters: risk can be calculated from known distributions, uncertainty cannot. This means that attribution models provide a false sense of precision that can be more dangerous than acknowledging uncertainty honestly, because false precision leads to confident but wrong decisions.\n\nThe convergence of Duke's resulting bias and Kay and King's radical uncertainty creates a devastating critique of standard attribution practices. Marketers judge campaigns by outcomes that are heavily influenced by factors outside marketing's control (resulting), while the attribution models that attempt to isolate marketing's contribution provide spurious precision about inherently uncertain relationships (radical uncertainty). The combination means that attribution-driven decisions are simultaneously biased and imprecise.\n\nThe path forward requires embracing what Binet and Field call 'broad and dirty' measurement over 'narrow and clean' approaches. This means using multiple imperfect metrics (mental availability, Share of Search, brand tracking, econometric modeling) rather than relying on any single attribution model. It means measuring over longer timeframes, acknowledging uncertainty ranges rather than point estimates, and separating decision quality from outcome quality. The most important marketing effects are the hardest to attribute, and the most easily attributed effects are often the least strategically important.",

    "brief": "Q3 establishes the most comprehensive evidence base for marketing effectiveness while simultaneously exposing the measurement crisis threatening it. Brand building ROI is real but only visible over 6+ month timeframes (Binet & Field), with the Bass Diffusion Model proving mathematically that ads accelerate early growth and maintain permanently higher sales trajectories (LinkedIn B2B Report). The Consumer Behaviour textbook confirms the underlying mechanism: the advertising response curve follows diminishing marginal returns, making one exposure per person the most cost-effective frequency. This convergence of empirical, mathematical, and theoretical evidence makes the case for brand building overwhelming.\n\nMental availability metrics provide better tracking than traditional awareness measures (Romaniuk), with brand salience conceptualized as the probability that a customer will think of the brand at some point in time (Brand Salience Research). The Distinctive Asset Grid gives practitioners a systematic framework for measuring fame and uniqueness. Brands that go dark lose 10% market share per year (Phua et al., JAR 2023), making the cost of advertising cessation quantifiable for the first time. The evidence for continuity is now irrefutable, with even reduced-weight continuous campaigns protecting brand health more effectively than sporadic high-intensity bursts.\n\nGEO represents the next frontier of visibility optimization for AI-driven search, where AI visitors convert at 4.4x higher rates and LLMs can be manipulated through strategic text sequences (Harvard). Share of Search, validated by an IPA coalition including Google, LinkedIn, Unilever, and Kantar (Hankins, WARC), provides a freely available leading indicator of market share, with EDO research confirming that market share growers show corresponding search engagement rates. Attention quality, not just viewability, determines advertising impact: attentive seconds per thousand impressions reveals that 25% of TV ads play to empty rooms, while three seconds of attention produces 14x brand attribution (Lumen/WARC).\n\nDouble jeopardy confirms growth comes from penetration, with penetration measures rising dramatically, often doubling between a quarter and a year (DJ 50 Years On). The w(1-b) approximation provides mathematical precision to this law. Advertising elasticity shows diminishing returns favor reach over frequency, with the Consumer Behaviour textbook providing detailed analysis of the concave response curve. The 95-5 rule means 95% of potential buyers are out-of-market, making brand building essential for future demand creation. The Five Principles of Growth (SOV, brand-activation balance, reach, mental availability, emotion) provide a complete strategic framework, and brand building reduces price sensitivity, growing volume while protecting margins.\n\nReach accounts for approximately 83% of the variation in media effectiveness (Media in Focus), making it by far the most consequential media planning variable. System1's research confirms that broad reach is superior to tight targeting for brand building. Yet the marketing effectiveness crisis, driven by short-term metrics and flawed attribution, continues to push budgets toward narrow targeting and activation. Marketing scientists applied relevant methods under controlled scientific conditions (Consumer Behaviour, p.601) to establish these laws, but the industry systematically ignores them.\n\nThe attribution reality is that most models systematically undervalue brand building, corrupted by resulting bias (Duke: outcomes contaminate evaluation of decision quality) and radical uncertainty (Kay & King: probabilistic estimates are unhelpful for unique situations). Kahneman's Noise compounds the crisis through inconsistent measurement. The solution requires measuring what matters over the timeframes that matter, using multiple imperfect metrics rather than single attribution models, and having the courage to invest in activities whose returns are real but not immediately measurable. The industry must embrace appropriate uncertainty rather than the false precision that is destroying brand equity across categories.",
